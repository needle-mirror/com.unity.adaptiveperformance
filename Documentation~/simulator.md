# About Adaptive Performance Simulator extension

The Device Simulator Extension adds an additional section to the [Device Simulator](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DeviceSimulator.html) window to let you simulate thermal and bottleneck events in the Editor. This should help you to test your Adaptive Performance implementations in the Editor without the need to deploy to the device. The extension uses the 'SimulatorAdaptivePerformanceSubsystem' to simulate the events.

# Using Adaptive Performance Simulator extension
